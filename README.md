# Blank Slate Template

This repository is intentionally minimal so you can start a fresh JavaScript project from scratch. Nothing is wired up yetâ€”add whatever tooling, frameworks, or runtime code you need.

## What you get

- `package.json` with a placeholder `start` script.
- Empty `src/`, `public/`, and `tests/` directories ready for your code.
- `.gitignore` that omits common Node artifacts.

## Getting started

1. Install your preferred dependencies with `npm install <package>`.
2. Replace `src/index.js` with your application entry point or remove it if you plan to use a different structure.
3. Populate the README with details about your project once you begin building.

Happy hacking!
